# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a Rock Paper Scissors game that can be played by entering game(); in the console. 

It allows the user to play Rock, Paper, or Scissors against the computer for 5 rounds, and then displays the final score in the console.

## What I Learned

* How to use return statements within functions (can't use multiple return statements in one function)
* To make sure variables are global and not local when they need to be accessed across functions
* Possible to use '+' to concatenate functions (eg anyCase.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + anyCase.toLowerCase().slice(1);)

# Rock Paper Scissors: Update 11/17/2021

Developed a UI for the game so that it is playable in the browser without using the console.

## What I Learned

* How to use DOM methods (how to target nodes with selectors)
* How to add effects to buttons using CSS
